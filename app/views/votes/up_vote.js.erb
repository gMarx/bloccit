//need to update the post.points by 1 here
// it's possible to do this by have the entire `votes/voter` section re-rendered, which only includes the up and down arrows + the count.
//If this can be done w/ only re-render of the count, that would be ideal

//using class of 'js-votes' to signal teh div to replace in this re-rendering.
//1st idea is have the entire partial re-render, so place this div w/ corresponding class around all calls to render the voter partial
// -- not DRY, should go in the voter partial?



//idea
//use exactly what's in the partial - it will re-render it, so the calculation will be done.
